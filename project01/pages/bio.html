			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>My Name is Andrew Rains I was born in San Antonio, Texas and moved here to Califonria in 1999, where I've lived ever sense. I have four Siblings and two dorky parents named Dave and Katie Rains. I am the middle child of the group with one older brother and sister and one younger brother and sister, so i basically have the whole package as far as siblings go. Growing up I enjoyed playing baseball, basketball, and skateboarding. I Also enjoyed tinkering with materials, building skateboards, potato cannons, and catapolts. From building thing I later transitioned into making art in order to put something more decorative on my skateboards. Art is where I found my passion for creating and have developed many skills in order to grow my career as an artist/graphic designer.</p>
			<h4>Where I come from?</h4>
			<p>I Was born in San Antonio Texas where my parents basically grew up. My Parents are a couple of southern souls who grew up in Oklahoma and Texas. My Mother grew up in Oklahoma City and has four siblings as well which is why I think I have so many siblings too. My Father was born in Louisville, Kentucky but grew up in a small border town of Mcallen, Texas. Growing up my parents really did a good job ingraining family oriented activities such as family dinners and road trips in order to help us not only understand the importance of family but to help us be friendly social people. </p>
			<h4>How I define myself</h4>
			<p>I define myself as a pretty simple guy who loves to make art, hang out with friends, and tries to be as adventurous as possible with in reason. Art for me has always been an outlet for me and helped me create a way to escape from the this crazy reality. I'm also a pretty goofy person and not afraid to embarress myself by saying dopy things. Although sometimes being an open book gets me into silly trouble but overall letting out my true sell for me helps me be a more geniune.</p>
			<h4>What I like</h4>
			<p>I'm the kind of person who can handle long tedious projects that has helped me to figure out issues and create a work ethic especially when it comes to making artwork. One of my favorite things to do is pulling an all nighter on an in depth painting or artistic project. The reason I like doing this from time to time is because it allows escape and reach the inner depth of my consciousness. I also really enjoy camping although I don't get to do it nearly as much as I like. Camping also profides a nice peaceful escape and provides a refreshing new rebute of the spiritual battery.</p>
			<h4>What am I going to doin the future?</h4>
			<p>I hope to develop a successful and fulfilling career in the graphic arts. When I was younger I always wanted to start up my own skateboarding company designing and manufacturing my own decks. Who knows maybe that will still be in the cards. Overall my main objective is to quit my current job working at Pepboys which has been a good job but I can feel myself outgrowing this stage or work in my life. </p>

			<h4>Design Philosophy</h4>
			<p>My main philosphy for design is the acronymn K.I.S.S, Keep It Simple Stiupid. It doesnâ€™t matter whether you are designing a boat or a boot, simplicity always works. Strip things down to their essential, core purpose and you get the most fundamental, simplified version of the object. Overall my philosphy also arounds solving  problem and answering the question why.</p>
