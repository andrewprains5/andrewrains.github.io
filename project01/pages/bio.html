			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>My Name is Andrew Rains I was born in San Antonio, Texas and moved here to Califonria in 1999 where I've lived ever sense. I have four Siblings and two dorky parents named Dave and Katie Rains. I am the middle child of the group with one older brother and sister and one younger brother and sister, so i basically have the whole package as far as siblings go. Growing up I enjoyed playing baseball, basketball, and skateboarding. I Also enjoyed tinkering with materials building skateboards, potato cannons, and catapolts. From building thing I later transitioned into making art in order to put something decorative on my skaeboards. Art is where i found my passion for creating and have developed many skills in order to grow my career as an artist/ graphic designer.</p>
			<h4>Where I come from?</h4>
			<p>I Was born in San Antonio Texas where my parents basically grew up. My Parents are a couple of southern souls who grew up in Oklahoma and Texas. My Mother grew up in Oklahoma City and has four siblings as well which is why I think ihave so many siblings as well. My Father was born in Louisville, Kentucky but grew up in a small border town in Mcallen, Texas. Growing up my parents really did a good job ingraining family oriented activities such as family dinners and road trips in order to help us not only understand the importance of family but to help us be friendly social people. </p>
